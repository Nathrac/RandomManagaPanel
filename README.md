A simple project that when ran, finds a random manga and opens a random page from that manga in your browser.
**Learning Objectives:**
- Lightly introduce myself to interacting with APIs
- Learn more fundamental C++ syntax
- Re-familiarize myself with Git/Github source control

***Please note this is not a fully fledged out project I plan on perfecting and has limited functionality***
- Currently only works on Windows
- Proper HTTP request handling not implemented
- Random page currently can include non-art panels (i.e. rear cover page, blank pages, etc) 

**Acknowledgements:**
- This project uses the MangaDex API for all manga related info
- httplib header file was used handle GET requests to the MangaDex API
- nolhmann/json was used to parse json files
